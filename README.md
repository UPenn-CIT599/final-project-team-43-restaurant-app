A program to simulate the operation of a fast serve taco restaurant. 

## Getting Started

Load project into IDE
Find tacoRunner class and  select run.

### Prerequisites

PC with java IDE and Java SE.........

### Installing

TBD


### How to Run
When you first open up the application, you will see the customer home page. You, the customer, will have a unique Customer ID located on the bottom right of the home page. This ID changes each time the application is run because it is assumed that a different customer opens our applications each time.  On the top tab of our customer home page, click on "View Menu" and explore the vast menu of our restaurant.  We have tabs for taco, drinks, and sides, each item with their own picture and description.  

Ordering:  After checking the menu, you can either go back to the customer home page or order now.  Clicking on "Order Now" will bring to our order page.  Here, you will need to select a service type, your food and drinks, and your delivery address as well if you selected the service type "Delivery".  After selecting all the items you would like, click on the "Check Price" button to confirm the total price of all the items in your cart.  The available funds assigned to each customer is basically a random number that ranges from $30-$40.  Do not allow your total cost to exceed your available funds as you will go into our bad order page if you click place order!  Also, be sure to enter your delivery address if you selected "Delivery" or you will also be confronted with the Bad Order page and will need to restart your order entry. Successful orders will bring you to the window that states "Your order has been placed".  When you see this window, check the "CustomerOrders.csv" file and you will notice that your most recent order is recorded into the last line of the file.  This is how we keep a record of all the orders that were placed and will be used by the other classes in our program.  Additionally, if you would like to check how much funds you have left after making your order, simply click the "Place an Order" button on the customer homepage and inspect your available funds box.  It should be the difference of your initial funds minus the cost of the order that was just placed (funds can reset by taking the role of a new customer, which is essentially re-running the program). 

Reservations:  If you would like to place a reservation, click on the "Reservations" button in the customer home page.  Choose the date and time you would like to reserve a seat for "Dine in" service and click "Make Reservation".  The time is the local time of your area, so make sure to choose a day/time combination that is in the future or else you will be asked to remake a reservation.  Successful reservations will not only show a window that confirms the day/time of your order, and will will also write your reservation into the "CustomerOrders.csv" file.

Reviews:  If you would like to write a review, or view previous reviews of our restaurant, click on "Our Reviews" in the customer home page.  Simply select 1-5 from the stars drop down box and also a message of your experience and click "Write a Review".  This will save your review into our "restaurantreviews.csv" file, which will then be read for the new review entry and displayed in the review table.
